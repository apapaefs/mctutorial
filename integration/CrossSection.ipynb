    "# Integrating for the Cross Section\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, we will extend our Monte Carlo integration method to perform an integral to get the *cross section* for a specific process.\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember that the cross section is defined as (See Mark Thomson, page 70): \n",
    "\n",
    "$\\sigma=$ (number of particles per unit time per target particle)/(incident flux),\n",
    "\n",
    "and an expression for $2 \\rightarrow 2$ scattering was derived, in the center-of-mass (C.O.M.) frame: \n",
    "\n",
    "$\\sigma = \\frac{1}{64 \\pi^2 s}\\frac{p_f^*}{p_i^*} \\int |\\mathcal{M}_{fi}|^2 \\mathrm{d} \\Omega^*$,\n",
    "\n",
    "where the $*$ indicates that the quantities are defined in the C.O.M. frame, and $s$ is the Mandelstam variable. \n",
    "\n",
    "All the physics of the process is encapsulated in tha matrix element $\\mathcal{M}_{fi}$. The rest of the expression is related to the \"kinematics\" of the process, i.e. energy and momentum conservation. \n",
    "\n",
    "$\\frac{ \\mathrm{d}{\\sigma} } { \\mathrm{d} \\Omega^*}$ is known as a differential cross section, so in order to find the total cross section $\\sigma$, we need to perform an integral over the solid angle $\\Omega^*$. Recall that $\\mathrm{d} \\Omega^* = \\mathrm{d} \\phi^* \\mathrm{d} (\\cos \\theta^*)$ (i.e. the solid angle element is the angular part of the spherical polar coordinate volume element). \n",
    "\n",
    "Generally speaking, integrals over differential cross sections will be complicated multi-differential and multi-dimensional functions of several variables, and therefore the Monte Carlo technique is the ideal method for solving them. In the first example we will consider here, the cross section can also be calculated analytically. However, we are going to use this as a first step towards understanding Monte Carlo event generators. "
